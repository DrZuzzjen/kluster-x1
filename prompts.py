KLUSTER.AI TWEET TEMPLATE TO FOLLOW:
{template_example}

<think>
Let me analyze this kluster.ai template structure:

1. ATTENTION GRABBER: "ðŸš¨ Just launched:" - Creates urgency and novelty
2. PRODUCT INTRODUCTION: "Meet [Product] by http://kluster.ai: [One-line value prop]"
3. BENEFIT EXPLANATION: Clear description of what it does and why it matters
4. FRICTION REMOVAL: "No [pain point]. No [pain point]. No [pain point]." - Removes objections
5. CALL TO ACTION: Clean link with branded URL

Now I need to extract from the documentation context:
- What specific capability/feature should I highlight?
- What pain points does this solve that I can negate with "No X. No Y. No Z."?
- What's the core value proposition that would stop someone scrolling?
- How does this fit kluster.ai's positioning as reliable AI infrastructure?

Looking at the documentation: {context[:500]}...

I should craft this to match kluster.ai's voice - direct, technical but accessible, benefit-focused.
</think>

Using the kluster.ai template structure above, create a tweet about {subtopic} that:

1. Starts with an attention-grabbing opener (emoji + urgency/novelty)
2. Introduces the kluster.ai capability with clear value prop
3. Explains the benefit using insights from the documentation
4. Removes friction with "No X. No Y. No Z." format using real pain points from the docs
5. Ends with a clear call to action

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Extract specific details from the documentation context provided
- Use kluster.ai's confident, technical tone
- Focus on the exact capability described in the docs
- Maximum 280 characters
- Include "http://kluster.ai" naturally in the messaging

Output only the tweet text."""
